            Some time ago I was intruduced to the concept of Myers Briggs Type Indicators. According to a group of platonic aquantances, a series of seemingly simple and arbitrary questions could identify the “4 key cognetive functions” a person uses to think, processes
            information and (more or less) act. The idea of every man, woman, child, and house-plant being categorized into 16 predefined classes seemed nonsencical, but I was intruiged enough to further investigate.

            Filled with confidence in my inability to fit into predefined profiles, I welcomed MBTI as a challenge. If anyone could break it’s personality-factoring shenanigans, it was going to be me. Unfortunately, my aspirations were immediately cut short by my
            (suprisingly knowledgeable) group of colleagues.

            You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. You can create anything that makes you happy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.

            No need to take the test. You’re a textbook ENTP.
